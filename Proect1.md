# Lifting
[This paper](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01718012/document) looks very interesting to me.  Robust cost functions are often used in navigation and other places where outliers (e.g., faulty sensor measurements) may be present.  This paper claims that by using "lifting" they get much more accurate and better convergence properties.  Is this true for cases that we are interested in?  What is the cost computationally?  Are there ways we can speed it up?

* For an introduction to lifting, [this paper](ftp://ftp.esat.kuleuven.be/pub/SISTA/ida/reports/10-45.pdf) looks good.
